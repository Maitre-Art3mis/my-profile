			<h2>"What have I done ?" - <i>Anakin</i></h2>
			<p>I am a very creative person, I am intersted by social interactions and by online medias.
					It inspired me into creating with my friend Dimitri a discord server called <i>"Le Café"</i>, a social hub where everybody is welcomed
					(as long as they follow the rules that is) regardless of what their interest are which differ a lot from the main idea of dicord which is
					that each server is supposed to focus on one main theme.<br>So far it has proven to be a great experiment, we have peaked up to 300
					members in summer of 2020.
